    <h1>Final Project</h1>
       <strong>Final Project for CSC 106</strong><br>
        <p>Hungry, Hungry, Laura is a game I created for my CSC 106 class.
           The objective of my program is to create a fun game for my CSC 106 course at URI. 
           The game starts with an opening screen where you see the name of the game, my bitmoji, a start button, and an instruction button. 
           The instructions page tells you how to play the game. 
           In the game, you control the Laura bitmoji using the left and right arrows on the keyboard. 
           Pieces of food will be falling from the ceiling and the goal is catch twenty pieces of food to fill Laura up. 
           The counter in the top, left-hand corner will count how many pieces you have caught so far. 
           Once ten pieces of food have been caught, the game will switch to a congratulations screen where you will have the option to go back to the main menu to play again. 
           I got the idea from the Hungry, Hungry Hippo board game and the Hoppy Beaver game on Khan where the beaver collects sticks.</p>
