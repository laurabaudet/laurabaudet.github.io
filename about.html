      <p>Hi everyone! I am making this webpage for my first Computer Science course at URI.
      I am a returning undergraduate student trying to get a second degree in Computer Scicence. My first degree is in Clinical Psychology.
      I currently work full time at a substance abuse clinic in the morning and work on my classes in the afternoon.
      I live in Newport, RI with my significant other and our three dogs, Luna, Kylo, and Mace.
      Luna is a 5 year-old puggle; Kylo is a 3 year-old Shiba Inu; and Mace is a 6 month-old German Shepherd.
      In my free time I like to go to the beach, hang out with friends, read, watch tv, and cook.</p>
